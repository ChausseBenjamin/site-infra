# About

Hi, I'm Ben. I've alway liked toying with computers, trying to see what they're
capable of, testing their limits. Today, I'm studying Computer Engineering to
get to do this for a living. I believe doing what you like for a living is
important. I also believe that having many interests and pushing everyone to
it's limits makes for a shrewd mind. That's one of the many reasons why I enjoy
also doing things away from a computer, such as rock climbing, composing music,
photography just to name a few. I'm a firm believer in the idea that the most
fulfilling endeavours are the ones where you are constantly learning. This is
why I always want to push hobbies I have further. Becoming more proficients in
things I enjoy forces me to learn, and thus, become a better person.

# Projects

If you truly enjoy tech, you'll inevitably get to have fun building with
it in a variety of scenarios, wether that be in University, at your workplace, in
the comfort of your home. Across the years, I've done quite a few projects, trying
to learn new things, facilitate daily redundant tasks I find irritating, or just make
my life more enjoyable. Here are just a few of my favourites:

# Contact

I'm not the biggest fan of modern socialized networks. Most of the time, good
old fashion email is the way to go. With the right tools, notably
[OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/), it's possibly to communicate simply and
securely.

If you've noticed something in one of my git projects, feel free to submit an
issue directly on github. I generally maintain a copy of my repos on gitlab with
the most of the development happening on github. This might be subject to change one day.

If you like what you see, and you would like a more concise (and formal) summary of my
achievements, jobs and qualifications, you can download a copy of my CV right here:
